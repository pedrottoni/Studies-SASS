                    This guide explains how to use the
                    Google Fonts API to add fonts to your
                    web pages. You don't need to do any
                    programming; all you have to do is
                    add a special stylesheet link to
                    your HTML document, then refer to
                    the font in a CSS style.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Then open the file in a modern web
                    browser. You should see a page
                    displaying the following, in the
                    font called Tangerine:
                    That sentence is ordinary text, so
                    you can change how it looks by using
                    CSS. Try adding a shadow to the style
                    in the previous example:
                </p>
                <p>
                    Requesting multiple fonts allows you
                    to use all of those fonts in your page.
                    (But don't go overboard; most pages
                    don't need very many fonts, and
                    requesting a lot of fonts may make
                    your pages slow to load.)
                    The Google Fonts API provides the
                    regular version of the requested fonts
                    by default. To request other styles
                    or weights, append a colon (:) to the
                    name of the font, followed by a list of
                    styles or weights separated by commas
                </p>
