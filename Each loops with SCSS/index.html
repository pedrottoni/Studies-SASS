            On the other hand, we denounce with righteous indignation and
            dislike men who are so beguiled and demoralized by the charms
            of pleasure of the moment, so blinded by desire, that they
            cannot foresee the pain and <a class="youtube" href="#">trouble</a> that are bound to ensue;
            and equal blame belongs to those who fail in their duty through
            weakness of will, which is the same as saying through shrinking
            from toil and pain. These cases are perfectly simple and easy
            to distinguish. In a free hour, when our power of <a class="community" href="#">choice</a> is
            untrammelled and when nothing prevents our being able to do
            what we like best, every pleasure is to be welcomed and every
            pain avoided. But in certain circumstances and owing to the
            claims of duty or the <a class="articles" href="#">obligations</a> of business it will frequently
            occur that pleasures have to be repudiated and annoyances
            accepted. The wise man therefore always holds in these matters
            to this principle of selection: he rejects pleasures to secure
            other greater pleasures, or else he endures pains to avoid worse <a class="preto" href="#">pains.</a>
